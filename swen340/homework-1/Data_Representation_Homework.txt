SWEN-340: Data Representation - Homework 1


Instructions:
    1. All signed values are 8 bits wide and unsigned values are 8 bits wide.
       (An 8 bit signed value uses 2's complement format).
    2. Provide hexadecimal values in 0x... format (C language format)
    3. Edit this text file and record your answer.
    4. Also for every answer show the manual steps required to arrive at you answer by editing this text file.
    5. Submit your edited text file to the MyCourses assignment folder "Homework 1".
       All submissions MUST be text files.
    6. All questions are worth one point


Questions:
    1. Convert decimal 95 to hexadecimal.
       Answer: 0x5F
       Reasoning: 95%16 = 15, 5%16 = 5
           

    2. Convert 0x1CD to unsigned decimal. (Hint: Convert it to binary first!)
       Answer: 461
       Reasoning: 1x16^2 + 12x16^1 + 13x16^0 = 256 + 192 + 13
       
    3. What is the value of binary 10101011 in decimal if this is a negative number?
	   Decimal Answer:  -85
	   Reasoning: -2^7 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 
	   
    4. What is the value of binary 111001111 in decimal if this is an unsigned number?
       Decimal Answer: 231
	   Reasoning: 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0
	   
    5. Add 0x8BCD and 0x02E6 (assume unsigned numbers):
       Hexadecimal Answer: 0x8EB3
       Reasoning: 8EB3. They are added normally as long as the resulting sum is 15 or less. The leftovers from C + E and D + 6 carried over. 
	   
    6. Add 8 bit binary integers 10101111 and 11011011
       Hexadecimal Answer: 10001010
       Reasoning: A one is carried over everytime and eventually reaches the limit so it gets truncated.
	   
    7.	How many bits are in each of the following data types?
		
		a. Byte			Answer: 8 bits
		b. Word 		Answer: 16 bits
		c. Doubleword	        Answer: 32 bits
		d. Quadword		Answer: 64 bits 
		e. Nibble		Answer: 4 bits


    (Questions 8-10 deal with the following registers. This register
    is taken from ST Microelectronics' reference manual for their STM8S and
    STM8AF series microcontrollers, for those who are curious)
    Assume you have an embedded device with the following register:
    
    Port X Output Data Register (Px_ODR)
        Address Offset: 0x00
        Reset Value: 0x00
          7      6      5      4      3      2      1      0
        ODR7 | ODR6 | ODR5 | ODR4 | ODR3 | ODR2 | ODR1 | ODR0 

    Suppose you are given C code that defines the register as follows
    (assume P1_BASE_ADDR is defined elsewhere):
        uint8_t *p1_odr = (uint8_t *) P1_BASE_ADDR;

	8. Suppose current value of the register is 0xC1. You are asked to set ONLY the ODR2 bit in P1_ODR to 1. What will be new register value?
		Hexadecimal Answer: 0xC5
			Reasoning: 1100 0001 | 0000 0100 = 1100 0101 
                                   0xC1 | 0x04 = 0xC5
			

	9. Suppose current value of the register is 0xC1. You are asked to set ODR2 & ODR5 bits in P1_ODR to 1 AND clear 0DR0 bit (i.e. set to zero). What will be new register value?
		Hexadecimal Answer: 0xC4
			Reasoning: 1100 0001 | 0010 0100 = 1110 0101
                                   1110 0101 & 1111 1110 = 1110 0100
			

	10. Write C code that sets ONLY the ODR2 bit in P1_ODR to 1
		Answer:
                       p1_odr* = p1_odr* | 0x04
